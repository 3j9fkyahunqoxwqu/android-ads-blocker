# android-ads-blocker
Block ads the easy way on Android, no tools, no crap &amp; no ads! 



Why you should prefer this solution over the other million solutions that are avbl.?

* It's clean and you can directly see what will be blocked
* No ressource wasting because app xyz is running in the background and want to update it 
* It's flashable via .zip directly after a ROM update


Is this an replacement for AdGuard?

* No, AdGuard comes with more features but to block hosts my solution should be enough. Such porgrams such as AdGuard are designed to not only block the entire hosts more to fine control and replace also banners, this means they also handle complex in-app specific things while hosts only block the entire domain only.


Do I really need other tools?

Depending what you do with your phone, my goal is to lower the communication(s). In fact in 99% all my experience it's enough to block just the domain.


But some apps 'caching' there ads how to get rid of them?

In this case you definitly need other apps because even you block xyz domain the ads are 'hardcoded' within the app which needs illegal manipulation of the apps (often called ad-free) or (if avlb.) you need to manually remove the cache from the app, but's depending on the method and how the ads are implemented.


What are your domain sources and researches?
* MVP HOST
* Malware domains 
* others (I will update credits and sources with links of course if everything is done)


Drawbacks
* Since I not use facebook I block this, so you possible need to commit out everything with facebook
